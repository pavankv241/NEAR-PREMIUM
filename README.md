# NEAR-PREMIUM

A Premium Pay-per-view Video Platform built on NEAR Blockchain

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that allows creators to upload premium video content and monetize it through NFT-based access tokens on the NEAR blockchain.

## Features

- **Premium Video Upload**: Upload high-quality video content to IPFS
- **NFT-based Access**: Each video is minted as an NFT for access control
- **Pay-per-view Model**: Users pay to access premium video content
- **NEAR Wallet Integration**: Seamless blockchain transactions
- **Creator Monetization**: Direct revenue for content creators

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## How It Works

1. **Content Creators**: Upload premium videos and mint them as NFTs
2. **Viewers**: Purchase access to videos by acquiring the corresponding NFTs
3. **Blockchain Security**: All transactions and access control managed on NEAR
4. **IPFS Storage**: Decentralized video storage for reliability
